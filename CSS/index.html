    <h1>Ghost Love Score Lyrics</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>[Verse 1]
            We used to swim the same moonlight waters
            Oceans away from the wakeful day

            [Chorus]
            (My fall will...)
            My fall will be for you
            My love will be in you
            If you be the one to cut me
            I'll bleed forever
            (... be for you)
            My fall will be for you
            My love will be in you
            If you be the one to cut me
            I'll bleed forever
        </p>
        <p>Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
            Brings me to thee, into the blue memory

            [Chorus]
            (My fall will...)
            My fall will be for you
            My love will be in you
            If you be the one to cut me, I'll bleed forever

            (... be for you)
            My fall will be for you
            My love will be in you
            If you be the one to cut me, I'll bleed forever

            Into the blue memory
        </p>
        <p>A siren from the deep came to me
            Sang my name my longing
            Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
            Worth everything I may ever be
        </p>
        <p>The Child will be born again
            That siren carried him to me
            First of them true loves
            Singing on the shoulders of an angel
            Without care for love ‘n loss
        </p>
        <p>[Bridge 1]
            Bring me home or leave me be
            My love in the dark heart of the night
            I have lost the path before me
            The one behind will lead me

            Bring me home or leave me be
            My love in the dark heart of the night
            I have lost the path before me
            The one behind will lead me

            [Bridge 2]
            Take me
            Cure me
            Kill me
            Bring me home
            Every way
            Every day
            Just another loop in the hangman’s noose
        </p>
